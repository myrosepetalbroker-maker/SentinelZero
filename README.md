## 🎯 Overview
**SentinelZero** is a **proactive, continuous risk analysis platform** for smart contracts and DeFi protocols on BNB Chain.  
It aggregates **historical exploits**, applies a **standardized risk taxonomy**, and generates **dynamic risk scores**, helping developers, auditors, and investors **prevent exploits before they occur**.

> “Building trust in BNB Chain, one contract at a time.”

**Key Areas:**  
- **Primary:** Yield Discovery & Risk Analytics  
- **Secondary:** Web3 Developer Tooling

🛑 Problem Statement

Even audited smart contracts remain vulnerable to repeated exploits.
Smaller projects often lack resources for continuous monitoring, leaving protocols on BNB Chain exposed to attacks and financial losses.

SentinelZero addresses this gap with a data-driven, automated approach to identify risks and reduce potential exploits.

🗓️ Roadmap (6 Months)
Phase	Duration	Deliverables
Phase 1	6–8 weeks	Historical exploit database
Phase 2	8–12 weeks	Taxonomy & initial scoring
Phase 3	12–16 weeks	MVP dashboard
Phase 4	4–6 weeks	Whitepaper & open-source documentation
💡 Expected Impact

✅ Improved visibility of smart contract risks

✅ Reduced likelihood of post-audit exploits

✅ Provides actionable insights to developers and investors

✅ Encourages best practices across the BNB Chain ecosystem

💰 Budget Estimate (USD)
Phase	Cost
Phase 1	$15,000
Phase 2	$30,000
Phase 3	$45,000
Phase 4	$20,000
Total: $110,000
